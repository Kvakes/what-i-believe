		<p>The essay was published in 1884, but Bureau of Censorship immediately banned it and confiscated all copies. But some of the books were taken by Bureau's high-rank employees, by Minister of Internal Affair gr. Tolstoy, by other ministers and by the court. All the copies were taken from the Bureau, so the book, in an unusual way, despite utterly legally, was published.</p>
		<p>On Feb.24, 1901 Tolstoy was officially excommunicated from the Orthodox Church by the Holy Sinod.</p>
